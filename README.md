# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

## Overview:

This project involves the exploration and analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL queries. The dataset includes information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population statistics across different locations and continents.

## Objectives:

- Understanding the Impact:
  - Analyzing the total cases and deaths to understand the severity of the COVID-19 impact in various locations.
  - Calculating death percentages to assess the likelihood of fatality in specific regions.

- Population Impact:
  - Examining the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 to gauge the scale of the outbreak.
  - Identifying countries with the highest infection rates compared to their populations.

- Vaccination Analysis:
  - Investigating the progress of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.
  - Calculating the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine.

- Geographical and Temporal Trends:
  - Analyzing trends across continents, countries, and over time.
  - Identifying regions with the highest death count per population.

## SQL Techniques Used:

- Joins: Combining data from different tables to enrich the analysis.
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Utilizing CTEs for clearer and modular queries.
- Window Functions: Employing window functions for calculations over partitions.
- Aggregate Functions: Summarizing and aggregating data for higher-level insights.
- Temporary Tables: Using temporary tables for intermediate data storage.
- Creating Views: Building views to store specific datasets for later use.

## Skills Demonstrated:

- Data Exploration: Extracting valuable insights from complex datasets.
- SQL Proficiency: Leveraging a variety of SQL functionalities for analysis.
- Data Visualization Preparation: Preparing data for later visualization tools.
- Problem Solving: Addressing questions related to COVID-19 impact and vaccination trends.

## Future Steps:

This project lays the groundwork for further analysis and visualization.
